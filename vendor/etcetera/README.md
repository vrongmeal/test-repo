# Etcetera

This is a Rust library that aims to allow you to determine the locations of configuration, cache and data files for your application. Existing Rust libraries generally do not give you a choice in terms of which standards/conventions (Etcetera calls these ‘strategies’) they follow. Etcetera, on the other hand, gives you the choice.

See the documentation for more.
